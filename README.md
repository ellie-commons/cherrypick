Installation is as simple as installing the above, downloading and extracting the zip archive, changing to the new repo's directory,
and run the following command:

### On elementary OS or with its appcenter remote installed

```bash
flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --install-deps-from=appcenter --install builddir ./io.github.ellie_commons.cherrypick.yml
```

### On other systems:

First, install the elementary Flatpak runtime & SDK:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists appcenter https://flatpak.elementary.io/repo.flatpakrepo
